We are a chapter of the [Democratic Socialists of America](https://dsausa.org), north of the San Francisco Bay, with branches in Marin, Sonoma, and Mendocino Counties.

We seek to build a majority movement to liberate the United States of America from capitalism. Instead of a political-economic system serving an elite few, we envision a society based on democratic control of resources and production, and social and economic justice for all.

## Chapter

Most of the work in our chapter happens in our branches, but we share some resources to lighten the load.
