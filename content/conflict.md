# Conflict Resolution and Grievance Officer for North Bay DSA, Conflict Resolution Circle

## Overview

The cultures and societies in which our members live are deeply flawed, based on hierarchical systems of oppression which allow discrimination of oppressed groups, harassment, disenfranchisement, and other mechanisms of structural, emotional, and physical violence to flourish. Many members have been directly harmed by these and other forms of oppression and carry their effects.

We also recognize that many have also received benefits, borne entirely of societally-accorded privileges, such as whiteness, able-bodiedness, cis-gendering, and hetero-masculinity. Laying bare the functions of these privileges is essential if we are to: understand how biases harm minority and disenfranchised groups; and how privilege is perpetuated by legitimizing certain viewpoints as normative (whiteness, colonialism, heteronormativity, etc.).

We come together, in hopes of creating an internal dynamic that recognizes individual histories (and how these may impact interactions) and that seeks to resist and undo the societal hierarchies. Not only is such work essential to a harmonious environment in which North Bay DSA members can thrive, but also to challenge the mechanisms by which our society, as a whole, recreates and perpetuates violence and oppression.

## Purpose

The Conflict Resolution Circle (CRC) operates with two goals.

Goal 1. The CRC will establish and provide informal and confidential support for: resolving internal issues, such as interpersonal conflicts before they escalate; support for members dealing with a particular concern or issue; and resources whereby members can engage in self-reflection, develop skills of self-criticism, and develop skills that promote a non-hierarchical environment.

Goal 2. The CRC will provide Grievance Officers (GO) to address serious violations of the [Code of Conduct](/conduct#north-bay-dsa-code-of-conduct) per Resolution 33 of the national DSA and that may result in disciplinary action. Members seeking to file a confidential complaint can [find the form here](https://forms.gle/B9nMPqb61gNRkKdj6). More information on Grievance Officers, the grievance process, and what constitutes an offense, [please see here](/conduct#when-is-the-grievance-process-applicable).

We encourage all participants in DSA NB to reach out to us. Please note that while we will seek to de-escalate and assist individuals, we are not professionals. We provide a list of resources for members in crisis and supplemental [self-education resources here](/conduct#resources).

## Structure

The CRC will be comprised of at least four volunteers, two of whom will serve as mediators in conflict resolution (CR), and two of whom will serve as Grievance Officers. The two functions will not overlap. We want to ensure that CR is not involved in any formal grievance process so as to preserve their function as nonjudgmental listeners and confidential advisors to any member seeking their help. Likewise, no active GO will serve as a CR counselor; and while an active GO may recommend that a member seek Conflict Resolution as a possible step toward redressing a grievance filed against them, such a recommendation is never mandatory since CR counsels on a voluntary request basis.

Members of the CRC will be approved by the GA. The CRC operates according to principles of [community accountability](/conduct#principles-of-conflict-resolution-circle-code-of-conduct). Vacancies in the Grievance Officer role must be filled within 60 days. Removal of a GO follows the same procedures as removal of Officers.

Every effort will be undertaken to ensure the CRC positions are not composed entirely of cis-gendered white males.

## Policy and practices:

This document is a working set of practices, and will be modified by the CRC, based on input from the membership, to best meet the needs of our chapter.

### Training

The CRC, working with local resources, will provide at least one annual workshop to train peers interested in working as mediators and to cover topics critical to constructive and enaged interpersonal interactions, and to the overall stability of DSA-NB. All members of DSA-NB are strongly encouraged to attend. The CRC may coordinate with the Political Education committee to provide trainings on oppression awareness. The training will also cover specific skills such as group- and self-facilitation during meetings, de-escalation techniques, therapuetic communication skills, self-de-escalation, self-criticism, and mechanisms for enhancing every member's ability to participate fully.

We ask that individuals seeking assistance from the CRC review this link in order to better understand what outcomes and processes are available to them.

### Acknowledgements

We gratefully appreciate the Conflict Resolution and GO processes developed by DSA-SF, DSA-LA, and DSA-Twin Cities. The DSA-NB is indebted to their work and has drawn heavily from their efforts.

We are here to create a the kind of activist and relationship space we hope to see in the larger society. Please let us know if we can be of help. (Links 2 and 6) We are here to serve.
